### How to Get FREE Chrono Crystals Glitch in Dragon Ball Legends

Before we dive into the details, make sure you understand that this glitch is for educational purposes. It’s important to be aware that using exploits in online games can sometimes violate terms of service, so proceed with caution and always be mindful of the game’s rules. While this glitch has worked for many players, there is a chance it could be patched or removed at any time.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Claiming FREE Chrono Crystals:

1. **Ensure You’re Using the Latest Version of Dragon Ball Legends:**
   - First, make sure that you have the latest version of Dragon Ball Legends installed on your device. To check if an update is available, head to your app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store) and update the game if necessary.
   - This is crucial because older versions may not support the glitch, and it could affect your ability to claim the Chrono Crystals.

2. **Enable Developer Options on Your Device:**
   - **For Android**: Go to Settings > About Phone > Tap "Build Number" seven times to unlock Developer Options.
   - **For iOS**: Developer options are limited, but some tweaks can be done via third-party apps or jailbreaking. For the safest and most stable approach, we recommend sticking with Android for this glitch.

3. **Backup Your Game Data:**
   - Before proceeding with any glitch or hack, always ensure that your game data is backed up. This will help protect your account in case anything goes wrong.
   - You can link your game to your Google Play (Android) or iCloud (iOS) account for safe backup.

4. **Access the Chrono Crystal Glitch:**
   - **Android Method**: Open your Dragon Ball Legends game and disconnect from the internet. This can be done by turning off Wi-Fi or mobile data.
   - Once disconnected, navigate to the in-game shop where Chrono Crystals are sold. You should be able to see the purchase options.
   - Tap on a Chrono Crystal pack, and when the payment window appears, immediately cancel the purchase and reconnect your internet connection. The system will register that the purchase was incomplete, but in some cases, it might still give you the Chrono Crystals as a “glitch reward.”
   
   - **iOS Method**: Unfortunately, iOS devices have more limitations regarding game exploits. However, by following third-party methods that involve specific apps or modified game files, you might be able to access similar results. These methods can be risky and often require jailbreaking the device, which we strongly advise against for security reasons.

5. **Repeat the Process:**
   - For additional Chrono Crystals, repeat the glitch multiple times. Be cautious, though, as excessive use of this glitch can raise suspicion in the game’s monitoring systems, which might lead to your account being temporarily or permanently banned.

6. **Claim Your FREE Chrono Crystals:**
   - After successfully completing the glitch, your account should have the extra Chrono Crystals ready to be used. These crystals can now be used to summon your favorite characters, enhance your fighters, or progress through challenging missions.

### Why Is This Glitch Working Now? (2025 Update)

The reason this glitch is still working in 2025 is because the developers of Dragon Ball Legends have focused more on adding content and improving gameplay mechanics rather than aggressively patching minor exploits. However, this doesn’t mean the glitch will stay around forever. Developers are known to tweak game mechanics and systems, so the glitch may be removed in future updates.

We suggest taking full advantage of this free Chrono Crystal glitch while you can. Many players have already used it to summon top-tier characters, which can dramatically change the way you experience Dragon Ball Legends.

### Tips for Maximizing Your FREE Chrono Crystals

Once you’ve got your free Chrono Crystals, you’ll want to make the most out of them. Here are some tips to help you use your crystals efficiently:

1. **Focus on Summons with High Value:**
   - Look for limited-time banners and high-rate summon events that feature powerful characters. These banners tend to offer a better return on your investment, allowing you to get the best fighters for your team.

2. **Upgrade Your Best Fighters:**
   - Use your Chrono Crystals to upgrade your favorite characters. This includes boosting their power levels, enhancing their abilities, and increasing their stats. This will make your team stronger and improve your performance in PvP matches.

3. **Save for Special Events:**
   - If you’re not in immediate need of Chrono Crystals, it’s a good idea to save them for special in-game events or crossover collaborations. These events usually introduce limited-time characters and items, and you’ll want to have enough Chrono Crystals to get them.

4. **Don’t Waste Crystals on Unnecessary Purchases:**
   - Avoid spending Chrono Crystals on small boosts or items that won’t help your gameplay. It’s better to use them strategically for summons and major upgrades.
